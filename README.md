# EDXD · Elite Dangerous eXploration Dashboard

### A cross-platform, real-time dashboard for explorers:
* **100 % Python** – runs on Linux, macOS and Windows (no .NET, no exe).

### Features
* **Show estimated scanned/mapped value** - is it worth firing up the SCO?
* **Distance from entry point** - time for a hutton-mug of coffee?
* **Planetary surface materials** – instantly see every deposit in a system.
* **Bio-signals & landability** – icons indicate biomasses and whether a body is landable.
* **Dual detail panes** – one for the selected row, one for your current in-game target.
* **System progress** – live counter of scanned / total bodies (belt clusters ignored).
* **Dark “ED” theme** – looks at home next to EDMC / EDSM.

### Planned:
* show first discovered (EDSM)
* show potential types of biosigns, if any; update on DSS and on foot sampling
* show potential types of geosigns, if any; update on DSS
* maybe more...
